## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eli, and I'm a University of Arkansas student interested in all things Python & Data Science!

- :checkered_flag: I'm currently working on on my Senior Capstone, **Cadillac F1 Driver Performance Analysis**, turning raw race data into winning strategies.
- ðŸ”­ I recently built a [**NASA APOD Data Pipeline**](https://github.com/eli-rosee/nasa-apod-pipeline), condensing the universe down to a local database.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying **Data Mining, Algorithms, Formal Languages & Computability, and Information Retrieval**, deepneing my understanding of theoretical C.S. and strengthening python skills in AI and data.
