## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eli, and I'm a University of Arkansas student interested in all things Python & Data Science!

- :checkered_flag: I'm currently working on on my Senior Capstone, **Cadillac F1 Driver Performance Analysis**, working with the Cadillac F1 team to build an AI powered tool to analyze and gain insight from F1 telemetry data.
- ðŸ”­ I recently built a [**NASA APOD Data Pipeline**](https://github.com/eli-rosee/nasa-apod-pipeline), a program to scrape and store astronomy images and image metadata in SQLite.
- ðŸ“š I'm currently studying **Data Mining, Algorithms, Formal Languages & Computability, and Information Retrieval**
