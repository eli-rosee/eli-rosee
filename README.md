## Hi there 👋

My name is Eli, and I'm a University of Arkansas student interested in all things Python & Data Science!

- 🔭 I'm currently working on my Senior Capstone: **Cadillac F1 Driver Performance Analysis** — exploring telemetry data, clustering driving styles, and building a dashboard for performance insights with the Cadillac F1 Data Analytics Team.  
- 🛰️ Recently built a **NASA APOD Data Pipeline** — scraping and storing daily astronomy image metadata in SQLite for future analysis with Pandas/NumPy.
- 🌱 Currently studying **Data Mining, Algorithms, Formal Languages & Computability, and Information Retrieval**. Deepening my understanding of computer science from a mathematical/theoretical perspective while developing key AI/data skills and Python toolkits.
